# Outline

The outline of your final project should serve as the building blocks for the rest of your presentation.  In week 4 you're introduced to Shorthand (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. as one option you have at your disposal for creating your final project deliverable.  Shorthand also has a handy template you can reference for creating an outline of your projectPreview the document.  Your outline should be a document that you can later use to help fill in some of the details around your project.  

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

    A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
    A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.

## Key Dates & Deadlines

## Challenges
Finding accurate data
Munging data from disparate sources
Data might not confirm the story I want to present which would complicate my narrative.

**NEED TO ADD MITIGATION**

## Measuring success
User research with 3-5 individuals to understand story they believe I am telling. This will be supplemented with hallway feedback


# The Data

This project will primary use data from the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs conducted by the 
US Census Bureau.

I will also attempt to validate my analysis against other publicly available entrepreneurship research (e.g. [The Kauffman Index Entrepreneurship Series)](https://www.kauffman.org/kauffman-index)

I will conduct exploratory data analysis on the different data sets and attempt to combine datasets where it makes sense to understand sub-segments. Where possible I will also examine summary statistics and/or trends at the state level.

# Method and medium

I intend to use Shorthand for my visual storytelling. I plan to generate static charts and graphs that I will upload to Shorthand. I will be exploring several tools to create these charts including:
* Datawapper
* Infogram
* Tableau
* D3.js
* Vega
* Highcharts.js
I will also consider interactivity if it enhances my storytelling and I can find the right data and tools to implement it.
