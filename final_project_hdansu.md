# Part 1

## Project Name: **Exploring the Entrepreneurship Landscape in America**

## Project structure

The structure of my story will be as follows:<br/>
**Setup:** Entrepreneurship is presented as a very narrow and specific process in terms of industry, founder background, and funding.<br/> 
**Conflict:** Challenge perception by showing the scope of backgrounds who found businesses and do it in different ways.<br/>
**Resolution:** Starting your own business is an achievable goal that the reader should consider.<br/>

The key points to cover in this story will be:
* Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Race, Education and Veteran Status of business founders 
* Source and amount of seed capital
* Reasons for owning business
* Industries & Geographies

## Key Dates & Deadlines

## Challenges

Challenge | Mitigation
--- | ---
Finding accurate data | Use only reliable data sources such as Census Bureau data
Data might not confirm the story I want to present | Final narrative after preliminary data analysis

## Measuring success
User research with 3-5 individuals with open ended questions supplemented with hallway feedback


# The Data

This project will primary use data from the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs conducted by the 
US Census Bureau.

I will also attempt to validate my analysis against other publicly available entrepreneurship research (e.g. [The Kauffman Index Entrepreneurship Series)](https://www.kauffman.org/kauffman-index)

I will conduct exploratory data analysis on the different data sets and attempt to combine datasets where it makes sense to understand sub-segments. Where possible I will also examine summary statistics and/or trends at the state level.

Downloaded csv files for data I have already accessed can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W_cTRHZG1Z2jgojnfvCO1VtDU7o-gh2r)


# Method and medium

I intend to use Shorthand for my visual storytelling. I plan to generate static charts and graphs that I will upload to Shorthand. I will be exploring several tools to create these charts including:
* Datawapper
* Infogram
* Tableau
* D3.js
* Vega
* Highcharts.js

<br/>
I will also consider interactivity if it enhances my storytelling and I can find the right data and tools to implement it.

# Part II

Sketches
Wireframes 
Storyboards

## Story Outline

Developed story outline and relevant components you proposed in Part I visually through the use of sketches and storyboards. 

Sketches should be individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. 
(use draft versions of visualizations as sketches).

## User Research Protocol
Develop a user research protocol and documented findings l for showing your early sketches, storyboards and wireframes to 3 - 5 individuals.  Your user research protocol should identify the following: 

### Target audience you hope to reach with your story

Use persona tool?

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

### Interview script
### Findings from your interviews
### Changes implemented to sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.

##

3. Begin developing your sketches and breaking down storyboards into wireframes, reflecting what you've identified and learned through your user research.   For the purpose of this assignment, your wireframes should essentially be an early draft of your final project that includes your project outline, sketches, and brings your storyboards to life.  For most of you this will mean that you've created a digital outline or shell that you can then begin to further refine and improve heading into Part III, but it should begin to feel complete enough that an external reviewer can easily tell how you're beginning to craft yours story. 

Therefore you should begin taking your outline and building out the structure of your story into whatever you identified in your Part I proposal.
