## Project Name: **Exploring the Entrepreneurship Landscape in America**

## Project structure

The structure of my story will be as follows:
**Setup:** Entrepreneurship is presented as a very narrow and specific process in terms of industry, founder background, and funding
**Conflict:** Challenge perception by showing the scope of backgrounds who found businesses and do it in different ways
**Resolution:** Starting your own business is an achieveable goal that the reader should consider

The key points to cover in this story will be:
* Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Race, Education and Veteran Status of business founders (most recently available)
* Source and amount of seed capital
* Reasons for owning business

## Challenges

Challenge | Mitigation
--- | ---
Finding accurate data | Use only reliable data sources such as Census Bureau data
Data might not confirm the story I want to present | Final narrative after preliminary data analysis

## Measuring success
User research with 3-5 individuals with open ended questions supplemented with hallway feedback


# The Data

This project will primary use data from the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs conducted by the 
US Census Bureau.

I will also attempt to validate my analysis against other publicly available entrepreneurship research (e.g. [The Kauffman Index Entrepreneurship Series)](https://www.kauffman.org/kauffman-index)

I will conduct exploratory data analysis on the different data sets and attempt to combine datasets where it makes sense to understand sub-segments. Where possible I will also examine summary statistics and/or trends at the state level.

# Method and medium

I intend to use Shorthand for my visual storytelling. I plan to generate static charts and graphs that I will upload to Shorthand. I will be exploring several tools to create these charts including:
* Datawapper
* Infogram
* Tableau
* D3.js
* Vega
* Highcharts.js

<br/>

I will also consider interactivity if it enhances my storytelling and I can find the right data and tools to implement it.
