# Outline

The outline of your final project should serve as the building blocks for the rest of your presentation.  In week 4 you're introduced to Shorthand (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. as one option you have at your disposal for creating your final project deliverable.  Shorthand also has a handy template you can reference for creating an outline of your projectPreview the document.  Your outline should be a document that you can later use to help fill in some of the details around your project.  

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

    A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
    A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  

# The data

It's critical that you identify a data source in the first week.  To be successful in the final project, you'll need to get a copy of the data you'll need for your final project, or recreate it based on various sources.  Make sure in all cases to record your sources and cite these data sources appropriately. 

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

## A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
## A link to the publicly-accessible data you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

# Method and medium

In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.  One option we've already discussed is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media, etc.).  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 

Finally, for your final project I'd discourage an over-reliance on PowerPoint slides. If you need to use a few slides to frame the context of your final project for your presentation that's ok - but I'd rather you create something that can live beyond the course and benefit you later that won't require a future employer browsing through yet another PowerPoint deck.
