# Part 1

## Project Name: **Exploring the Entrepreneurship Landscape in America**

## Project structure

The structure of my story will be as follows:<br/>
**Setup:** Entrepreneurship is presented as a very narrow and specific process in terms of industry, founder background, and funding.<br/> 
**Conflict:** Challenge perception by showing the scope of backgrounds who found businesses and do it in different ways.<br/>
**Resolution:** Starting your own business is an achievable goal that the reader should consider.<br/>

The key points to cover in this story will be:
* Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Race, Education and Veteran Status of business founders 
* Source and amount of seed capital
* Reasons for owning business
* Industries & Geographies

## Key Dates & Deadlines

## Challenges

Challenge | Mitigation
--- | ---
Finding accurate data | Use only reliable data sources such as Census Bureau data
Data might not confirm the story I want to present | Final narrative after preliminary data analysis

## Measuring success
User research with 3-5 individuals with open ended questions supplemented with hallway feedback


# The Data

This project will primary use data from the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs conducted by the 
US Census Bureau.

I will also attempt to validate my analysis against other publicly available entrepreneurship research (e.g. [The Kauffman Index Entrepreneurship Series)](https://www.kauffman.org/kauffman-index)

I will conduct exploratory data analysis on the different data sets and attempt to combine datasets where it makes sense to understand sub-segments. Where possible I will also examine summary statistics and/or trends at the state level.

Downloaded csv files for data I have already accessed can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W_cTRHZG1Z2jgojnfvCO1VtDU7o-gh2r)


# Method and medium

I intend to use Shorthand for my visual storytelling. I plan to generate static charts and graphs that I will upload to Shorthand. I will be exploring several tools to create these charts including:
* Datawapper
* Infogram
* Tableau
* D3.js
* Vega
* Highcharts.js

<br/>
I will also consider interactivity if it enhances my storytelling and I can find the right data and tools to implement it.

# Part II: Sketches, Storyboards, and Wireframes 


## Story Outline

Developed story outline and relevant components you proposed in Part I visually through the use of sketches and storyboards. 

Sketches should be individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. 
(use draft versions of visualizations as sketches).

### Target audience you hope to reach with your story

Use persona tool?

## Sketches

## User Research Protocol
Develop a user research protocol and documented findings l for showing your early sketches, storyboards and wireframes to 3 - 5 individuals.  Your user research protocol should identify the following: 

[User research approach & script](/user_research_plan.md)

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

### Interview script



### Findings from your interviews

* It was not apparent to testees that the intended call to action was that they realize that starting a business is an achievable goal.<br/>
* I clearly spent too much time thinking about tools and software for visualizations and not enough time upfront making sure the intended story was being told clearly. 

### Changes implemented to sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.
