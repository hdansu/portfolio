# About me
I trained as an engineer but my professional experience has been in consulting and product management. I am currently in the MISM-BIDA program. My interests lie in the intersection betweeen business and technology

# What I hope to learn
* In my professional life I frequently found it challenging to communicate new insights or findings in a visual medium. 
The first part of the challenge was in figuring out how best to lay out my ideas. 
Secondly, my audience was typically not familiar with non-bar chart visuals which limited my options. 
* Therefore, my goal is to refine how I communicate complex ideas in a visual medium. I would like to be communicate data insights/predictions/analysis more simply, clearly, and convincingly.

# Portfolio
My portfolio will be organized in the section below
