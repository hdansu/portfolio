Harold's public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data Class

# About me
I trained as an engineer but my professional experience has been in consulting and product management. I am currently in the MISM-BIDA program. My interests lie in the intersection betweeen business and technology

# What I hope to learn
* In my professional life I frequently found it challenging to communicate new insights or findings in a visual medium. 
The first part of the challenge was in figuring out how best to lay out my idead. 
Secondly, my audience would typically only know how to read common chart types (eg bar charts) which limited my options. 
* Therefore, my goal is to refine how I communicate complex ideas in a visual medium. I would like to be communicate data insights/predictions/analysis more simply, clearly, and convincingly.
