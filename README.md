# About me
I trained as an engineer but my professional experience has been in consulting and product management roles. I'm current in the MISM-BIDA program. My interests lie in the intersection betweeen business and technology

# What I hope to learn
* A professional challenge I frequently encountered was putting together presentations for audiences that did not have a quantitative background
* Another challenge was finding chart types (excluding tables and ar charts) tha were not confusing to broad audiences.
* Therefore, I hope to refine how I communicate complex ideas in a visually. I would like to be communicate data insights/predictions/analysis more simply, clearly, and convincingly.
