# Project Deliverable

## Project Name: **Exploring the Entrepreneurship Landscape in America**

## Data Story
Final data story was hosted in [Shorthand.](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/hdansu_entrepreneurship/index.html)
<br/>
A recap of the preceding project activities is below:

## Project Planning: Part 1

## Structure

The intended structure of my story was as follows:<br/>
**Setup:** Entrepreneurship is presented as a very narrow and specific process in terms of industry, founder background, and funding.<br/> 
**Conflict:** Challenge perception by showing the scope of backgrounds who found businesses and do it in different ways.<br/>
**Resolution:** Starting your own business is an achievable goal that the reader should consider.<br/>

The final story that was told was very similar to what was intended

## Key Dates & Deadlines

# Method and medium

I used Shorthand for my visual storytelling. I mostly used iframe/html to host dynamic charts. I used a few static charts also. Charts were created using:
* Plotly
* Infogram

I also created charts using Tableau and Datawrapper but these were excluded from the final presentation

## User Research Plan

[User research approach & script](/user_research_plan.md)


## User Research Phase 1

### Condensed findings from interviews
* Respondents thought the story was to provide statistics on the state of entrepreneurship
* The story felt "uneven" to most of the readers. The text introduction did not seem connected to the other visualizations
* It was not apparent to respendents that the intended call to action was that they realize that starting a business is an achievable goal
* Most repondents wanted to see certain statistics which were not available/not shown
* Overall, the intended message is not conveyed to users.I clearly spent too much time analyzing data and thinking about tools and software for visualizations and not enough time upfront making sure the intended story was being told clearly. 

### Changes to be implemented to wireframes
* Focus story on what is relevant to 22-34 year olds?
* Consider annotations and callouts to drive home salient points 
* I noted that I need to use color and font more deliberately in my final output


## User Research Phase 2
I did a lot of work to analyze census data so I was eager to show all the data. However, respondents were not able to easily identify the message of the story. I cut those sections out and only showed data points relevant to 20-34 year olds. 

### Condensed findings
* Respondents could follow story more clearly however only showing data somehow muted the scale of the problem. For example, it wasn't clear to some that share of young people starting business had been trending downwards and was a generational problem. They perceived it as a "snapshot-in-time" problem
* I initially did not want tot include a call to action. However most repondents found the story "informative." My interpretation of that was it would not be memorable

### Changes implemented
* Information for other age cohorts was included to give context. 20-34 year old highlighted on the chart to draw attention
* Added a final section highlighting the message. It seemed ok to "tell" after I had "shown" the story.
